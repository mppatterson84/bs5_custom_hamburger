# Bootstrap 5 Custom Hamburger

Use a Hamburger in place of the navbar-toggler-icon on a Bootstrap navbar.
Slim down and minify the Bootstrap CSS and Hamburgers CSS using Sass.
This repository relies on using VS Code with the extension 'Live Sass Compiler' and creating a project level settings.json file to modify the compiler settings.
This project uses Node.js and npm to install the Bootstrap and Hamburgers modules locally.
